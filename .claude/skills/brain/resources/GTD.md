# Getting Things Done (GTD)

GTD is a personal productivity methodology by David Allen.

## The Five Steps

### 1. Capture
Get everything out of your head into a trusted system.

- Use `/capture` for quick capture
- Don't organize during capture
- Capture everything - tasks, ideas, notes

### 2. Clarify
Process what you've captured.

- Is it actionable?
- What's the NEXT physical action?
- 2-minute rule: if < 2 min, do it now

### 3. Organize
Put things in the right place.

| If it's... | Put it in... |
|------------|--------------|
| Next action for project | Project's tasks |
| Standalone next action | Do Next list |
| Delegated | Delegated list + Person |
| Calendar-specific | Due date |
| Someday/Maybe | Someday list |
| Reference | Notes or Resources |
| Trash | Delete |

### 4. Reflect
Regular reviews keep the system trusted.

**Daily:** Check calendar, review Do Next
**Weekly:** Full review (see `/review`)

### 5. Engage
Do the work with confidence.

Choose based on:
- Context (where are you, what tools available)
- Time available
- Energy level
- Priority

## Smart Lists in Ultimate Brain

| GTD Concept | UB Implementation |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Inbox | No Project + No Tag + No Due |

## Key Principles

1. **Mind like water** - Trusted system = clear mind
2. **Next action thinking** - Always know the next physical step
3. **Horizons of focus** - Ground level to 50,000 ft view
4. **Weekly review** - Non-negotiable maintenance
