# PARA Methodology

PARA is a universal system for organizing digital information.

## The Four Categories

### Projects
**Definition:** A series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.

- Has a clear outcome/end state
- Has a deadline (even if self-imposed)
- Requires multiple tasks to complete
- Examples: Launch website, Complete tax filing, Plan vacation

### Areas
**Definition:** A sphere of activity with a standard to maintain over time.

- No end date - ongoing responsibility
- Requires continuous attention
- Has a standard to uphold
- Examples: Health, Finances, Career, Home, Family

### Resources
**Definition:** A topic or theme of ongoing interest.

- Reference material for future use
- Topics you're interested in
- Not tied to specific outcomes
- Examples: Programming, Cooking, Photography, Travel

### Archive
**Definition:** Inactive items from the other three categories.

- Completed projects
- Areas no longer active
- Resources no longer relevant
- Keep for reference, out of sight

## In Ultimate Brain

| PARA | Ultimate Brain | Implementation |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Projects | Projects DB | Status: Doing/Planned |
| Areas | Tags (Type: Area) | Ongoing responsibilities |
| Resources | Tags (Type: Resource) | Reference topics |
| Archive | Archived checkbox | On any database item |

## Organizing Principle

**Ask:** "In which project will this be most useful?"

If none → "Which area of my life does this belong to?"

If none → "Which resource topic does this relate to?"

If none → Archive or delete
