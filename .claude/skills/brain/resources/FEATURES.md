# Ultimate Brain Features Reference

Detailed explanations of Ultimate Brain features for coaching users.

## My Day

**What it is**: A daily planning dashboard that helps you focus on what matters today.

**How it works in UB**:
- Tasks with `My Day` checkbox enabled appear here
- Three phases: Plan (morning), Execute (day), Wrap-Up (evening)
- Separate from Due dates - My Day is about *intention*, Due is about *deadline*

**When to use it**:
- Morning: Select 3-5 tasks to focus on today
- During day: Work from My Day list, not full task list
- Evening: Uncheck incomplete items, plan tomorrow

**Example**: You have 50 tasks, but only 5 are realistic today. Check My Day on those 5 to create a focused list.

## Inbox

**What it is**: The GTD "inbox" - items needing clarification and organization.

**How it works in UB**:
- Tasks appear in Inbox when they have: No Project AND No Tag AND No Due date
- This is a "hot potato" area - items shouldn't live here long

**When to use it**:
- Use `/capture` to quickly add items without organizing
- Process inbox daily: assign project, tag, due date, or delete
- Goal: Empty inbox = trusted system

**Example**: Quick thought "call dentist" → capture to inbox → later process: add Due date, mark Do Next.

## Projects

**What it is**: Multi-step outcomes you're committed to completing.

**How it works in UB**:
Three project types:
| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Goals | Has deadline, links to Goal | Launch website by March |
| Ongoing | Maintenance, no end date | Weekly meal planning |
| SOPs | Process documentation | Client onboarding steps |

**When to use it**:
- Task needs 2+ steps? Make it a project
- Has a deadline? Use Goals type
- Recurring maintenance? Use Ongoing type

**Example**: "Prepare taxes" is a project (gather docs, review, file, pay). "File extension" is a task.

---

## Tags (Areas & Resources)

**What it is**: Organization categories for tasks and notes.

**How it works in UB**:
| Tag Type | PARA Equivalent | Examples |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| Area | Areas | Work, Health, Finance, Family |
| Resource | Resources | Recipes, Books, Travel |

**When to use it**:
- Areas: Ongoing responsibilities you maintain (no end date)
- Resources: Topics of interest or reference material
- Every task/note should have a Tag for findability

**Example**: "Health" is an Area (ongoing responsibility). "Nutrition Research" is a Resource (reference topic).

## Smart Lists

**What it is**: GTD-style categorization for task intent.

**How it works in UB**:
| Smart List | Meaning | When to Use |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| Do Next | Next actions ready to do | Task is clear, no blockers |
| Delegated | Waiting on someone else | You assigned it, tracking |
| Someday | Maybe later, not committed | Nice to have, low priority |

**When to use it**:
- **Do Next**: "What can I do right now?" list
- **Delegated**: Track what you're waiting for
- **Someday**: Park ideas without losing them

**Example**: "Research CRM options" → Do Next (you can start anytime). "Wait for Bob's feedback" → Delegated.

---

## Snooze (Deferred)

**What it is**: Hide a task until a future date.

**How it works in UB**:
- Set `Snooze` date property on a task
- Task won't appear in active views until Snooze date
- Different from Due: Snooze is "don't show me until", Due is "deadline"

**When to use it**:
- Task isn't relevant until future date
- Ticket goes on sale next month
- Follow up in 2 weeks

**Example**: "Book summer flights" snoozed until April 1 - won't clutter your lists until then.

---

## Goals & Milestones

**What it is**: High-level outcomes with measurable progress tracking.

**How it works in UB**:
- Goals: Big outcomes (annual, quarterly)
- Milestones: Checkpoints toward goals
- Projects link to Goals for progress tracking

**When to use it**:
- Annual/quarterly planning
- Tracking progress toward major outcomes
- Understanding what projects contribute to what goals

**Example**: Goal "Get fit" → Milestones "Lose 10 lbs", "Run 5K" → Projects link to this Goal.

---

## Recurring Tasks

**What it is**: Tasks that repeat on a schedule.

**How it works in UB**:
- Set `Recur Interval` (number) and `Recur Unit` (Day(s), Week(s), etc.)
- Optional: `Days` for weekly (Mon, Wed, Fri)
- When completed, Due date advances to next occurrence

**When to use it**:
- Regular maintenance: "Weekly review", "Pay rent"
- Habits: "Exercise", "Journal"
- Recurring deadlines: "Monthly report"

**Example**: "Weekly team standup" - Recur Interval: 1, Recur Unit: Week(s), Days: Monday.

---

## Time Tracking (Work Sessions)

**What it is**: Track time spent on tasks.

**How it works in UB**:
- Work Sessions database links to Tasks
- Start/End times, auto-calculated Duration
- See time spent per task, project, day

**When to use it**:
- Understand where time goes
- Bill clients accurately
- Identify time sinks

**Example**: Start session on "Write proposal", work 2 hours, stop session → Duration recorded.
