Notion’s
Home
section can show tasks from one or more
Task databases
in a single view. It is currently the only area in Notion that can integrate pages from
multiple
databases in a single view.
Pro-tip:
Using Home, you can combine your personal Tasks from Ultimate Brain with tasks from a team tasks database. This can help you to sidestep Notion’s lack of
granular database permissions
.
Ultimate Brain’s
Tasks database
is a Task database by default, meaning you don’t have to do anything to Ultimate Brain for your tasks to show up in Notion Home.
However, the My Tasks section in Notion Home contains a filter by default that will only show tasks where you are the Assignee.
Technically, the filter is
Assignee is Me
, where “Me” is a dynamic value for the current user.
To see your tasks from Ultimate Brain, simply remove this filter:
Click the
filter icon
in the My Tasks view.
Click the
Assignee: Me
filter.
Click the
•••
menu.
Click
Delete Filter
.
