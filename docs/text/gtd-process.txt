If you’re a fan of David Allen’s
Getting Things Done
method (and book), you’re in luck! Ultimate Brain comes with the best GTD dashboard for Notion.
It’s called the
Process
page, and it makes both the Task and Notes databases fully compatible with the GTD process.
In the 33-minute video above, I’ll give you an overview of GTD (in case you’re new to it), explain the decision-making process for new items that hit your inbox, and explain how to use the Process page to practice GTD.
