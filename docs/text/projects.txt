The
Projects
database stores all of your projects. (
Here’s how to find it in your template
)
Projects are useful ways to group tasks and notes that are all related to a common outcome, which should ideally be well-defined, measurable, and achievable.
Below you’ll find a reference guide for all database templates and properties in the Projects database. Properties are in alphabetical order.

Database Templates

Project
This template establishes a Project’s page as the “home base” for everything involved in that project. It displays note and tesks related to the project.

Research Project
Research projects are identical to normal projects, but they also leveral the concept of
Pulls
. These are Notes and Tags that you “pull into” a project, without directly relating them to the project.
This concept is typically only used by a small subset of users, so don’t feel any pressure to use it. That said, some users enjoy the ability to bring materials they’ve captured in other contexts into a Project. To do this, you can leverage two properties in the Projects database:
Pulled Notes
Pulled Tags
Pulled Notes lets you pull individual notes into the Pulled database view within the Research Project. Pulled Tags will pull
every
note from a Tag into the Pulled view, and will also show the Tag itself in the Pulled Tags section.

Properties
Copy link to heading
Archived
Type:
Checkbox
If checked, this project is Archived. It will be removed from all main views in UB, and show up in the Archived Projects section of the Archive page.
This follows the PARA principle – archived items are removed from the main lists and safely tucked out of sight.
Copy link to heading
Completed
Type:
Date
The date the project was actually completed. Compare with your Target Deadline to see how well you were able to predict the project’s timeline.
Copy link to heading
Created
Type:
Created Time
The date and time this project page was created.
Copy link to heading
Edited
Type:
Last Edited Time
The date and time this project was last edited.
Copy link to heading
Goal
Type:
Relation
A goal this project is a part of. This Relation property connected to the Projects Relation property in the Goals database.
Copy link to heading
Goal Tag
Type:
Rollup
If this project is related to a goal, this Rollup property shows the Tag (if any) to which the goal is related.
Copy link to heading
Latest Activity
Type:
Formula
Returns the date and time of the latest activity in the project – including the project itself, along with any tasks or notes directly related to it.
Used for allowing projects to be sorted by Latest Activity in certain views.
lets(
taskActivity,
prop(
"Tasks"
).map(current.prop(
"Edited"
)).sort().reverse(),
noteActivity,
prop(
"Notes"
).map(current.prop(
"Updated"
)).sort().reverse(),
editedList,
[prop(
"Edited"
)],
concat(taskActivity, noteActivity, editedList).sort().reverse().first()
)

Localization Key
Type:
Formula
This property allows you to define translated names for the Project database’s key Status options – Planned, On Hold, Doing, Ongoing, and Done.
These are important for filters in certain views within My Day and Task Manager.
/* If you would like to translate your Status option names, translate them in the Status property AND in this formula as well. Below, you'll see variables for each of the important Status options in Ultimate Brain. For each, you can replace the terms in quotes ("") with translated terms. The final argument (the List defined by the brackets) is the return value of this formula. It is a multi-dimensional List (e.g. array), where the most important element is the 2nd (index 1) of the top List. This sub-List contains all of the Status options that are considered Active.
Since Notion formulas don't let us access the Groups of Status properties (e.g. To Do, In Progress, Complete), this is the best way to get the Group of a translated (or added) Status option.
If you have added extra options that are considered Active, add them as strings between the brackets underneath the additionalActiveStatusOptions variable. This can be helpful if you want to define multiple stages for Active projects.
Example: ["Design", "Development", "QA"] */
lets(
planned,
/* Edit the term below this line to translated the Planned status. E.g. "Zaplanowany" */
"Planned"
,
onHold,
/* Edit the term below this line to translated the On Hold status. "Zastopowany" */

done,
/* Edit the term below this line to translated the Done status. "Zakończony" */

additionalActiveStatusOptions,
/* If you would like to add additional Active status options, add them as strings between these brackets. See the comment above for an example. */
[],
/* Do not edit anything below this line */
