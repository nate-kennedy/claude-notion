If you’d like to make changes to structure of the databases that power Ultimate Brain, you’ll need to
unlock
them first. Changes that require unlocking include:
Adding, editing, or deleting properties
Adding, editing, or deleting options in Select, Multi-Select, and Status properties
Adding, editing, or deleteing database automations
Databases are locked by default in order to prevent accidental changes. When databases aren’t locked, it can be easy to accidentally delete a property or change its type without realizing it (especially for folks who are newer to Notion).
Unlocking a database is easy. Simply navigate to the
source database
(not a linked database view), then click the
Locked
button at the top of the page.

Locating a Source Database
There are several ways to find your source databases in Ultimate Brain:
From the Ultimate Brain homepage, find the
Databases & Components
link at the bottom of the page.
Toggle open Ultimate Brain in the Notion sidebar, and find the
Databases & Components
page from there.
Either way, you can then click on the database you’d like to modify.
Alternatively, a surefire way of finding the source database in
any
Notion template is the following:
Click on any page in the database you’d like to modify.
If it’s in Side Peek or Center Peek, open it as a full page.
Use the
breadcrumbs
at the top of the page to navigate one level up – this is the source database.
