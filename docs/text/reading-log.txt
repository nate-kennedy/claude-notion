The
Reading Log
database stores all of your reading log entries. (
Here’s how to find it in your template
)
A log entry records the date, start and end page, and Book that you read.
Below you’ll find a reference guide for all database templates and properties in the Reading Log database. Properties are in alphabetical order.

This Relation property connects to the Logs Relation property in the Books database.

Details
Type:
Rich Text
Record any details about your reading session here.
While I’d recommend taking actual book notes in the Book entry, you could do it here, too.

End Page
Type:
Number
The page on which you ended the reading session.
Used with Start Page to calculate Pages Read.
Copy link to heading
Last End Page
Type:
Formula
The end page of the most recent previous log entry for this book. This property essentially functions as a bookmark, and can help you fill out Start Page for the next entry.
let
(
lastEntry,
prop(
"Book"
).first().prop(
"Logs"
).filter(not empty(current.prop(
"End Page"
))).sort(current.prop(
"Log Date"
)).reverse().first(),
"Page "
+ lastEntry.prop(
"End Page"
) +
", "
+ (lastEntry.prop(
"Log Date"
).format()).link(lastEntry.id())
)

Log Date
Type:
Date
The date of your reading session. This date should be auto-filled with the current date when you create a new entry.

Month Index
Type:
Formula
Used to make the Last Month view in the Reading Log work properly. When a log entry is from last month, this index will be -1. The “Last Month” view filters entries so that only those with -1 will be shown. This is done because Notion lacks a “last calendar month” filter.
dateBetween(
dateSubtract(now(), date(now()),
"days"
),
dateSubtract(prop(
"Log Date"
), date(prop(
"Log Date"
)),
"days"
),
"months"
) *
-1

prop(
