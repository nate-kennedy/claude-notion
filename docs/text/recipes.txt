Recipe w/ Shopping List
This template adds all the sections from the Recipe Template, and also adds a filtered view of the
Tasks
database, showing only tasks with the “Shopping” Context.
Note:
I added this view for folks who really want to create grocery lists in Notion, but I personally find it better to reference my recipes in Notion and add grocery items to the stock Reminders app on iOS.
