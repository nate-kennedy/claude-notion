Ultimate Brain is yours! Once you add the template to your Notion workspace, you can do anything you like with it. It becomes a set of blocks that are
completely separate
from the original template that you purchased.
In these docs, we have an ever-expanding collections of guides that can teach you how to customize your template and add new features to it. Check out the full
Customization
section in the sidebar to see them all.
If you’d like to make changes to your template, there are a couple of useful things to know:

Databases are Locked by Default
Many types of customizations will involve changing Ultimate Brain’s
databases
. These include:
Adding or changing options in
Select, Multi-Select, and Status properties
Adding new properties
Changing settings on existing properties
Deleting properties
Accessing the Customize Layout settings for a database
To make these changes you’ll need to
unlock the database you want to change.
By default, databases in Ultimate Brain are locked in order to prevent accidental changes.

Back Up Before Making Big Changes
If you’re thinking of making a significant change to your template, I recommend
backing it up
first.
While Notion
does have version history
, it is primarily designed to restore changes to a single page. In some cases, version history may be able to restore significant changes to databases, but this isn’t guaranteed.
Therefore, it’s a very good idea to make a
full duplicate
(aka a backup) of your current copy of Ultimate Brain before making a significant change.
Doing a backup before making changes is especially important if you’re newer to Notion and don’t yet feel like you understand it yet.
