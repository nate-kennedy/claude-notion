The
Tasks
database stores all of your tasks. It’s the primary database that drives task management in Ultimate Brain. (
Here’s how to find it in your template
)
Below you’ll find a reference guide for all database templates and properties in the Tasks database. Properties are in alphabetical order.
Note:
In versions of Ultimate Brain released prior to November 2024, this database is called
All Tasks.

Automations
This section is a reference for all automations that are included in the Tasks database. Each listed automation includes the following information:
Description of what the automation does
The automation’s default state (some automations are disabled by default)
When it was added to Ultimate Brain
A guide for building the automation, including screenshots and pastable formulas
Automations included in your template that are

menu, right-click the automation, and toggle it
Active.
Important:
Automations that are included in Notion templates can be
used
and
activated/deactivated
when your workspace is on Notion’s Free plan. However,
creating
and
editing
automations requires being on a paid Notion plan.
Learn more in Notion’s official docs
. If you’d like to edit the included automations, or update your template with new ones I release, you’ll need to be on a paid plan. Alternatively, you can
migrate your data to a new copy of the template
to get newly-released automations – though this can be complex, takes a long time, and isn’t something we can provide support for.

Task with Sub-Tasks
This template lets you easily add sub-tasks to a task. Note that while you can technically apply this template to sub-task pages themselves (effectively creating sub-sub-tasks), Ultimate Brain really only supports a single level of sub-tasks due to core Notion limitations.
Copy link to heading
Recurring Task w/ History
This template works along with our
Advanced Recurring Tasks
automation to show you each time you’ve completed a recurring task in the past. This template essentially enables light habit-tracking in Ultimate Brain (though Notion Automations still has limitations preventing us from easily seeing
skipped
instances of a habit).

Due Stamp (Parent)
Type:
Formula
If a task is sub-task, this returns the Due Timestamp value of its parent task. Otherwise, it simply returns this task’s own Due Timestamp value.
This property is the highest-priority sorting criteria for Task views within Projects. It keeps sub-tasks beneath their parent tasks.

Due Timestamp
Type:
Formula
Used to aid in correctly sorting tasks and sub-tasks within Projects.
If the task doesn’t have a Due date set, this timestamp will be 100 years in the future. This simply keeps tasks/sub-tasks without a due date below tasks that have one.

End
Type:
Button
Ends the current Work Session related to this task, if one is active.
Copy link to accordion section
End – Button Configuration
To configure the End button, first create a Define Variables action and name the variable Active Session. Type out the following formula
manually
:
This Page.Sessions.find(
current.prop(
"End"
).empty() and current.prop(
"Team Member"
).includes(Whoever clicked)
)
Code language:
JavaScript
(
javascript
)
Next, create an
Edit Pages In
step. In the database picker, choose your
Active Session
variable.
This will allow your button to edit pages within the
list
of pages returned by the formula, rather than needing a database and filter combo!
In this step, set
End
to
Time triggered.
Click Save.

Label
Type:
Multi Select
This property was previously called “Tag” in Ultimate Brain 3.0 prior to December 6, 2024. It was renamed on that date to prevent confusion with the
Tags
database, since Ultimate Brain doesn’t ship with a relation between this Tasks database and the Tags database by default.
Allows you to add labels to tasks, which will allow you to create label-based Board views in Project pages.
Useful if you want to organize tasks in a project by type – e.g. Dev, Marketing, etc. Unlock the Tasks db to add options.
This property has no options by default. Unlock the Tasks database in order to add options.

Localization Key
Type:
Formula
This property allows you to localize your template. If you want to translate the option names in the Days, Recur Unit, and Status properties, you can do so and then change the arrays in this formula to the same values.
This will allow formulas to keep working.
Copy link to accordion section
Localization Key Explained
Notion formulas are able to reference
property names
by their underlying ID. This means that if you have a working formula that references a property, you can change that property’s name later on and the formula will still work. If you look at the formula, you’ll see that any references to that property have updated to show the new name.
For example, if you translated the
Recur Unit
property’s name to
Unidad de Repetición
, you’d see this new name reflected in the
Next Due
property’s formula.
However, thie same cannot be
option names
in Select, Multi-Select, and Status properties – for example, options like “Day(s)” and “Week(s)” in the
Recur Unit
property. Even though these options technically do have IDs under the hood, the Notion formula language doesn’t provide us with a way to reference them.
This means we can only do plain old
string comparisons
for these options. For example:
if
(
prop(
"Recur Unit"
) ==
"Days(s)"
,
true
,
false
)
Code language:
JavaScript
(
javascript
)
The upshot here is that you can easily change the names of
properties
that are referenced in formulas (e.g. for localization purposes), but you can’t easily change the names of
options
in Select/Multi-Select/Status. If you do, string comparisons in formulas will always fail.
To solve this problem, we’ve included the
Localization Key
property in our templates. This formula returns a multi-dimensional array – essentially a list of lists. Each inner list contains a series of terms that match up to the option names in certain properties: Days, Recur Unit, and Status.
This allows us to do more robust comparisons in other formulas. For example, we can modify the above example to:
if
(
prop(
"Recur Unit"
) ==
"Days(s)"
or prop(
"Recur Unit"
) == prop(
"Localization Key"
).at(
1
).at(
0
),
true
,
false
)
Code language:
JavaScript
(
javascript
)
Arrays use
zero-based indexing,
which means the first element in an array has an index of
0
. Therefore, the above “address” in the Localization key is “2nd element of the outer list, 1st element of that inner list”. If you look at Localization Key’s code below, you’ll see that element is “Day(s)”.
This means you can localize your template without breaking formulas by updating Localization Key in addition to any property options.
For example, if you changed “Day(s)” to “Día(s)” in
Recur Unit
, you can update Localization Key in the same way – changing “Day(s)” to “Día(s)” in the formula’s code.
When the
Next Due
formula checks the value of Recur Unit against the hard-coded string “Day(s)”, it’ll be false – but then when it checks against the
array position
for “Day(s)” in Localization Key, it’ll return true, as expected.
In summary, simply make sure you update the correct option in Localization Key to the same value you use when updating property option names in the Recur Interval, Days, and Status properties.

Previous Versions
The current version of the Next Due formula (2.2.0) shown above requires a property named
Days
to be present in your template. Prior to
January 20, 2025,
this property was called
Days (Only if Set to 1 Day(s)).
If you duplicated your template prior to this date, we recommend updating that property name to
Days
, then pasting in the new formula shown above. It enables the new
Nth Weekday of Month
option in the
Recur Unit
property.
However, if you need the older version of the Next Due formula for any reason, here it is:
lets(
dueProp, prop(
"Due"

recurIntervalProp, prop(
"Recur Interval"

Recur Interval
Type:
Number
How often to make a recurring task recur. By default, this interval is a number of days – e.g an interval of 2 makes Next Due two days from Due (or today’s date). You can set a Recur Unit to adjust this.
Copy link to heading
Recur Unit
Type:
Select
Sets the unit of time that will be used by Recur Interval to set Next Due. E.g. if you set Week(s) here, then a Recur Interval of 2 will set a task to recur every 2 weeks.
Name
Description
Day(s)
Recur by days.
Example: If Recur Interval is 3, the task recurs every 3 days.
If you want a task to recur on specific days of the week, set Recur Interval to 1, then choose specific days in the Days property.
Week(s)
Recur by weeks.
Example: If Recur Interval is 3, the task recurs every 3 weeks.
If you want a task to recur during a specific week of each month, use the “Nth Weekday of Month” option instead.
Month(s)
Recur by months.
Example: If Recur Interval is 2, the task recurs every other month.
Tip: Use a Recur Interval of 3 to create a “Quarterly” recur schedule.
Month(s) on the First Weekday
Recur by months, always on the first weekday of the month (Mon, Tues, Weds, Thurs, or Fri).
Month(s) on the Last Weekday
Recur by months, always on the last weekday of the month (Mon, Tues, Weds, Thurs, or Fri).
Month(s) on the Last Day
Recur by months, always on the last day of the month.
Example: If Recur Interval is 2, and Due is December 31, Next Due will be February 28 (or 29 on a leap year).
Year(s)
Recur by years.
Example: If Recur Interval is 2, the task recurs every 2 years.
Nth Weekday of Month
E.g. “3rd Thurs of the Month”. (Weekend days work too)
This option only works if Days property is set, and only when Days has a SINGLE value.
For the example above, Recur Interval = 3, Days = Thursday.
Set Recur Interval to 1 for first week of month, 5 for last week of month.

Smart List (Formula)
Type:
Formula
This formula determines which Smart List (aka GTD list) a task is currently on. Used in the Process page.
It takes into account the following properties: Due, Snooze, and Smart List.
Possible values (in priority order): Calendar, Do Next, Delegated, Snoozed, Someday, Inbox.
ifs(
prop(
"Due"
),
"Calendar"
,
prop(
"Smart List"
) ==
"Do Next"
or prop(
"Smart List"
) ==
"Delegated"

Snooze
Type:
Date
Used in the Process and Process → Deferred pages for practicing GTD in Notion.
Adding a Snooze date moves a task to the Deferred list/page.
Note that only tasks without a Due date will show there. Due (Calendar) has higher priority than Snooze (Deferred).

Snooze (Parent)
Type:
Formula
If this task is a sub-task of a parent task that is Snoozed, this returns that parent task’s Snooze date as a timestamp. Otherwise, it returns this task’s own Snooze date as a timestamp.
Aids in sorting sub-tasks beneath their parent tasks in Process → Snoozed.
!prop(
"Parent Task"
).first().prop(
"Snooze"
)
