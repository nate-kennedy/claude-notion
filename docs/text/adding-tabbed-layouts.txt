Notion’s Tabbed Layouts feature allows you to add tabs to the page layout of databases. These tabs can each contain a view of a
related database
– e.g. another database that is connected to the current one via a Relation property.
You can use this feature to create tabs within
every
page of a database, each containing a useful view of related pages. For instance, in the Tasks database, you could create tabs to show:
Sub-Tasks
Recurring Task History
Time-Tracking Sessions

I also created a shorter overview video, which you can watch if you want a shorter introduction to this feature:
