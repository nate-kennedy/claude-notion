On this page, you’ll find quick tips on making small, database-related customizations in Ultimate Brain.
The sections on this page are typically created after we answer a similar question in our
customer community
, which you can access once you’ve
purchased Ultimate Brain
.
Note:
Before making a change to a database, you’ll always need to
unlock that database
first.
Copy link to heading
Change a Relation Property’s Page Limit
Relation properties can link to an unlimited number of pages within their connected database by default.
However, you can also change the
Limit
setting in a Relation property to
1 Page
. This creates a
1-to-many relationship
.
Some Relation properties in Ultimate Brain already have this 1-page limit setting. The Project Relation in the Tasks database is a good example; in almost all cases, a task should only belong to one project. If you that certain Relation properties in Ultimate Brain only allow you to choose a single page, this is why.
If you like, you can change this setting on any Relation property. Here’s an example video, where you’ll see me change this setting to allow multiple Tag pages to be related to a single Project:
To do this yourself (for
any
Relation property), start by navigating to the database that contains the Relation property and
unlocking it
.
Go to the Ultimate Brain homepage
Scroll down to find the
Databases & Components
page
Locate the
Projects database
Click the
Locked
button at the top of the page to unlock it
Once the database is unlocked, modify the Relation property:
Click on the property you want to change
Select
Edit property
Look for the
Limit
option in the property settings
Change the setting from
1 Page
to
No Limit
To test the change, open any page in the database. You’ll now see a
New
button instead of a
Replace
button next to your Relation property. Click
New
to create a
brand-new
page in the Relation’s connected database, or click the
magnifying glass
(🔎) to link another existing page.
