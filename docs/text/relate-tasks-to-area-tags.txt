In this tutorial, I’ll teach you how to directly relate
Tasks
to
Tags
(or Notes) in Ultimate Brain. This can be helpful for associating Tasks with
Areas
in the PARA system, since “Area” is a type you can apply to Tag pages.
This is a major modification to Ultimate Brain, so it’s a good example project for how you can make other large modifications. Before making any large modification, I recommend
backing up your template

Why Aren’t Tags Related to Tasks By Default?
In Tiago Forte’s
PARA system
,
Areas
represent “ongoing spheres of responsibility” – meaning they’re large areas or categories in your life where there are things you need to do.
By default, the way to “link” tasks with these Areas is to do the following:
Create an
Ongoing Project
for each Area (a
Project
with the
Ongoing
Status)
Associate that Project with its corresponding
Tag
, which should have the
Area
Type
.
I designed Ultimate Brain in this way in order to reduce the number of decisions users would need to make when processing tasks in their Inbox. Instead of needing to choose between clicking a Project or Tag property, you can simply click the Project property. There, you’ll see your Ongoing Projects alongside any one-time projects.
