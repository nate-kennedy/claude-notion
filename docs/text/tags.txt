The
Tags
database stores all of your tags. (
Here’s how to find it in your template
)
Tags can have different types, with the primary types being
Area
and
Resource.
Tags of these types are used to enable
PARA Method
organization in Ultimate Brain.
Below you’ll find a reference guide for all database templates and properties in the Tags database. Properties are in alphabetical order.

Status
Allows you to give this page a specific tag type.
If you practice PARA, you’ll usually want to choose Area or Resource. You can also use the Entity option to build meta-collections, such as “Essays”.
You should also choose the corresponding page Template in the page body below.
Name
Description
Group: To-do
Group: In progress
Entity
“Entity” is useful for building meta-collections in your second brain, such as “Essays” or “Apps”. It’s not part of PARA.

It’s often useful to apply both a Resource and an Entity tag to a page – e.g. “Programming” as a topical Resource and “App” as an Entity.
Area
In the PARA Method, an Area is an “ongoing sphere of responsibility”.

Areas represent the main categories of your life – Home, Work, School, Health, etc. They may have Notes, Projects, Goals, and even sub-Tags (such as a Resource).
Resource
In the PARA Method, a Resource is a “topic or interest that may be useful in the future”.

Resource is the default Type within the Tags database. Use Resources to organize Notes about a specific topic or subject.
